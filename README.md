A place to house the work I did in my Client Server Development course

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

During my work on this course I was keeping my code properly spaced and formatted with well worded comments keep the code readable so other can improve on or easily use my code. Keeping my code maintainable requires keeping it simple. Making things needlessly complicated and oversaturated with either repeated code or unused code can make it harder to find where certain actions are happening and therefore harder to find and fix bugs or add more features.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I always start a problem by brainstorming a solution. I get a rough idea of what I would need as well as a little of what techniques I know that could work. Next using the internet I see what others have done and how I could use their ideas to improve my work for my situation. This helps me to create work outside of skill level as well as increase my abilities for future projects. What was different here was I was new to Mongodb and had little knowledge about what my options for tools was. This make the research phase longer because I had to figure out how the databases worked before I could plan my widgets and code.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

computer sciencist make data visualize tools. All computers are the storage, movement and vizualize of data. My job, as a computer sciencist, is to take data and make it easier to read for everyone. This helps those who have different specialties to spend less time making informed decsions and spend less time informing themselves. For Grazioso Salvare their hundreds of animals can be filtered to only a few suitible options. This allows Grazioso to spend less time browsing for aniamls and select one button and know how many suitible animals and which one. This saves time and allows for more rescue animals to be sent out to save more lives.
